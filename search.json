    "text": "There’s no place like home. Most might associate that with Dorothy and the Land of Oz but it’s just as true in the game of baseball. Not every field is shaped the same, altitude, weather, and humidity all greatly effect how the game of baseball is played. Field factors aside, traveling is just awful, Long distance on a bus or an airplane aren’t fun for an average human, much less 6’7” Aaron Judge. Analysts and commentators talk about home field advantage all the time, especially around playoff season But is it real? Does staying off the road help teams win more? With so many factors at play, it’s no surprise that teams seem to have an edge when they’re at home.

Home win percentages are higher across the board, but a few teams really stand out. It makes sense, familiar routines, fan support, and no cross-country flights go a long way. Some teams, like the L.A. Dodgers, take full advantage, dominating at home like it’s a cheat code. The Astros and Braves are not far behind, but their home and away records are almost identical, proof they’re built to win anywhere. Then there’s the Colorado Rockies. They show a massive difference in wins and losses, but not because they’re dominant at home, it’s just that their road record is that bad. Overall, the trend holds true: home really is where the wins are.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\naway16 &lt;- read_csv(\"2016away.csv\")\naway17 &lt;- read_csv(\"2017away.csv\")\naway18 &lt;- read_csv(\"2018away.csv\")\naway19 &lt;- read_csv(\"2019away.csv\")\naway21 &lt;- read_csv(\"2021away.csv\")\naway22 &lt;- read_csv(\"2022away.csv\")\naway23 &lt;- read_csv(\"2023away.csv\")\naway24 &lt;- read_csv(\"2024away.csv\")\nhome16 &lt;- read_csv(\"2016home.csv\")\nhome17 &lt;- read_csv(\"2017home.csv\")\nhome18 &lt;- read_csv(\"2018home.csv\")\nhome19 &lt;- read_csv(\"2019home.csv\")\nhome21 &lt;- read_csv(\"2021home.csv\")\nhome22 &lt;- read_csv(\"2022home.csv\")\nhome23 &lt;- read_csv(\"2023home.csv\")\nhome24 &lt;- read_csv(\"2024home.csv\")\n\nhome &lt;- bind_rows(home16, home17, home18, home19, home21, home22, home23, home24) |&gt; filter(is.na(TEAM) == FALSE)\naway &lt;- bind_rows(away16, away17, away18, away19, away21, away22, away23, away24) |&gt; filter(is.na(TEAM) == FALSE)\n\nhome_totals &lt;- home |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM) |&gt; \n  summarise(HomeHR = sum(HR))\naway_totals &lt;- away |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM) |&gt; \n  summarise(AwayHR = sum(HR))\n\ncolor &lt;- home_totals|&gt;\n  filter(\n    TEAM == \"Chicago Cubs\" | \n    TEAM == \"Boston Red Sox\" | \n    TEAM == \"Los Angeles Dodgers\"\n  )\ncolor2 &lt;- away_totals|&gt;\n  filter(\n    TEAM == \"Chicago Cubs\" | \n    TEAM == \"Boston Red Sox\" | \n    TEAM == \"Los Angeles Dodgers\"\n  )\n\nchart1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=home_totals, aes(x=reorder(TEAM, HomeHR), weight=HomeHR), fill=\"grey\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Homeruns at Home (2016–2024)\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Total Homeruns\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") + \n  geom_bar(data=home_totals, aes(x=reorder(TEAM, HomeHR), weight=HomeHR)) + \n  geom_bar(data=color, aes(x=reorder(TEAM, HomeHR), weight=HomeHR), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\nchart2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=away_totals, aes(x=reorder(TEAM, AwayHR), weight=AwayHR), fill=\"grey\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Homeruns Away (2016–2024)\",\n    subtitle = \"Who brings the Bats to Games?\",\n    caption=\"Source: Matt Waite | By Emma Liberta\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Total Homeruns\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  + \n  geom_bar(data=away_totals, aes(x=reorder(TEAM, AwayHR), weight=AwayHR)) + \n  geom_bar(data=color2, aes(x=reorder(TEAM, AwayHR), weight=AwayHR), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\nchart1 + chart2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, when people think of iconic ballparks, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field are always top of mind. They’ve been around forever, almost as long as Albert Pujols. They’re historic and famous, for sure, but when it comes to giving teams a true advantage? Eh… These parks might be legends, but they’re more “middle of the pack” than baseball royalty. Fenway has the Green Monster and Wrigley has Wrigleyville, which mostly just feeds Chicago’s alcoholism. Those quirks don’t necessarily mean more home runs or better baseball. At some point, ‘historic charm’ is just code for ‘nothing’s been renovated since Babe Ruth was a rookie.’ Meanwhile, over on the West Coast, Dodger Stadium, despite being the biggest in the league, ranks toward the top when it comes to home runs. One would think that all that outfield space would keep the ball in play.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nhome16 &lt;- read_csv(\"2016homep.csv\")\nhome17 &lt;- read_csv(\"2017homep.csv\")\nhome18 &lt;- read_csv(\"2018homep.csv\")\nhome19 &lt;- read_csv(\"2019homep.csv\")\nhome21 &lt;- read_csv(\"2021homep.csv\")\nhome22 &lt;- read_csv(\"2022homep.csv\")\nhome23 &lt;- read_csv(\"2023homep.csv\")\nhome24 &lt;- read_csv(\"2024homep.csv\")\naway16 &lt;- read_csv(\"2016awayp.csv\")\naway17 &lt;- read_csv(\"2017awayp.csv\")\naway18 &lt;- read_csv(\"2018awayp.csv\")\naway19 &lt;- read_csv(\"2019awayp.csv\")\naway21 &lt;- read_csv(\"2021awayp.csv\")\naway22 &lt;- read_csv(\"2022awayp.csv\")\naway23 &lt;- read_csv(\"2023awayp.csv\")\naway24 &lt;- read_csv(\"2024awayp.csv\")\n\nhome &lt;- bind_rows(home16, home17, home18, home19, home21, home22, home23, home24)\naway &lt;- bind_rows(away16, away17, away18, away19, away21, away22, away23, away24)\n\nhomepitching &lt;- home |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM) |&gt; \n  summarise(home_era = mean(ERA))\nawaypitching &lt;- away |&gt; \n  group_by(TEAM) |&gt; \n  summarise(away_era = mean(ERA))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data = homepitching,\n    aes(x=home_era, y=TEAM), color=\"green\") +\n  geom_jitter(\n    data = awaypitching,\n    aes(x=away_era, y=TEAM), color=\"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"MLB Pitching ERA: Home vs Away (2016-2024)\", \n    subtitle = \"Each dot represents a team's average ERA at home (green) and away (red).

Familiar surroundings, supportive crowds, families and a little extra energy from sleeping in their own beds can make a difference. But then there are the Boston Red Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Colorado Rockies (shocker), Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays, who all have a lower ERA on the road. The Rockies, especially, hard to pitch when every fastball feels like it’s flying into the bleachers. While most teams thrive in their own ballparks, these few seem to save their best stuff for the road, leaving everyone wondering if their home-field advantage got lost at baggage claim.\nAll the quirks, comforts, and chaos of each ballpark paint a clear picture that home field advantage in the MLB is real. Whether it’s better sleep, crowd energy, or just knowing how the ball bounces off the wall in left field, being home matters. The stats back it up, teams pitch better, hit more confidently and win more in their own backyard. In baseball, as in life, there really is no place like home."

But no matter how early the grind begins, one thing’s for sure: there’s no one-size-fits-all path to the top.

MLB, on the other hand, is torn between drafting high school players with raw potential or pulling talent from college programs in the SEC and ACC.

With their massive fan bases, legendary traditions, and endless resources, these schools are more than just football teams, they’re institutions. They don’t need the SEC’s southern charm to draw recruits, they’ve got decades of reputation, enormous stadiums, and enough money to make it rain five-star prospects.

Up until 2016, high schoolers dominated the first round, but in recent years, but since then college players have started to take over. College ball now carries the weight, but high school players aren’t too far behind, still holding their ground with a solid pipeline of talent that’s hard to ignore. One of the key factors in this shift? The draft itself got cut in half, from 40 rounds to just 20, making each pick that much more crucial. With fewer picks, teams have become more strategic, leaning on college players who’ve already had the chance to refine their skills and prove themselves under pressure. Still, the gap between high school and college first-round picks isn’t as wide as it might seem, it’s more of a game of priorities than one side running away with the show.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nmlb &lt;- read_csv(\"MLBBBBBB.csv\")\n\ndraft &lt;- mlb |&gt;\n  select(Year = `Draft Year`, HighSchool = `High School`, College = `College/Univ`) |&gt;\n  drop_na()\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=draft, \n    aes(y=Year, x=`HighSchool`, xend=`College`),\n     size = 2,\n    colour = \"lightgrey\",\n    colour_x = \"#002D72\",\n    colour_xend = \"#D50032\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"College Players Are Taking Over the MLB Draft\", \n    subtitle=\"High school prospects once dominated, but a shift toward college talent raises questions—did the smaller draft or changing expectations drive the trend?\", \n    caption=\"Source: Pro Baseball Reference | By Emma Liberta\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t matter where a player comes from, the journey to the pros is all about the work put in. As Vidal Sassoon said, “The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary.” The path to the top is built on dedication, sacrifice, and moms driving to practice. Talent might get a player noticed, but where you display that talent, whether it’s in the SEC, a high school field, or overseas, determines how far you go. In the world of sports, where a player starts doesn’t matter, it’s all about how hard they’re willing to work to get there."
